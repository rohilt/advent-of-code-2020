# Solutions to 2020 Advent of Code

These are my solutions to the 2020 Advent of Code.

## Implementation
I wrote all of my solutions in Haskell, a functional programming language.

## Project Structure
To run my code to obtain the solution, I used the [just](https://github.com/casey/just) command runner.
For a solution from a particular day (for instance, day 3), I used the following command:
```
just day 3
```
There is a Python script (`scripts/fetch_input.py`) to fetch the input file if it does not exist.
